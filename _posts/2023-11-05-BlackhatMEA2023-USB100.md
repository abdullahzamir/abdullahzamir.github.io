#### Description:

In a shocking turn of events, a malicious actor managed to gain physical access to our victim's computer by plugging in a rogue USB device. As a result, all critical data has been pilfered from the system. Flag is direct without BHFlagY{} tag.



##### Solution:

opening the wireshark, we observe multiple files are transferred, most of which are JPEG images

Arranging the the packets by length

We find a `winPE` file which is likely to contain the flag

Copy the value
